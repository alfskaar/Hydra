I just finished my new toolchanger "Hydra".

CNC friendly
immortal (as in Hydra one part (as in head) will stay the same ones you select MGN9H, MGN9C, MGN12H, MGN12C, 6mm, 9mm belts.
Combining  CNC and 3d printed parts best from both worlds.

Very modular.
Pin mod for the belt. Iâ€™m not giving up on this as working on the 3d printer is so nice.

I currently have about 15 ðŸ¦· holding the belt, so that can maybe be made smaller number of tooth's. Credits "Boop".

NO heat inserts.

NO glue

Can be 3d printed or CNC or both.

Magnet strength can be adjusted two different ways. They are secure and have no way of getting out.

Credit for the rest is all currently available toolchanger you can find. E3D, Prusa, tapchanger, Stealthchanger. and so on.

"Hydra, in Greek legend, the offspring of Typhon and Echidna (according to the early Greek poet Hesiod's Theogony), a gigantic water-snake-like monster with nine heads (the number varies), one of which was immortal."

Todo:
