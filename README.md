08.03.2025 I have tested printing 2020 Extrusions 293mm looks very promising. :-) ðŸ¤© This also use MGN12H ðŸ˜Š

28.02.2025 15:00 I have a new version this one doesnâ€™t use any bearings or adjustments screws. Have less parts. Iâ€™m currently testing it. It use the spring from the Voron Extruder. I have not tested tool changes yet hopefully this doesnâ€™t introduce a new problem.

Singel tool tested and nothing found. Nice and tight and no play that affect the 3d print.
Parameters for Hydra toolchanger tested and tuned smooth as bacon in butter. :-) ðŸ§ˆ  10.04.2024

~~ ~~Just found my "MOSFET" isue. 23.03.2024 22:45:00 this take some time. ;-) it where pulling T1 (heater 1) to 0.70 volt and give it about 60 degrees Celsius. Fixed.~~ ~~

CNC friendly
immortal (as in Hydra one part (as in head) will stay the same ones you select MGN9H, MGN9C, MGN12H, MGN12C, 6mm, 9mm belts.
Combining  CNC and 3d printed parts best from both worlds.

Very modular.
Pin mod for the belt. Iâ€™m not giving up on this as working on the 3d printer is so nice.

I currently have about 15 ðŸ¦· holding the belt, so that can maybe be made smaller number of tooth's. Credits "Boop".

NO heat inserts.

NO glue

Can be 3d printed or CNC or both.

Magnet strength can be adjusted two different ways. They are secure and have no way of getting out.

Credit for the rest is all currently available toolchanger you can find. E3D, Prusa, tapchanger, Stealthchanger. and so on.

"Hydra, in Greek legend, the offspring of Typhon and Echidna (according to the early Greek poet Hesiod's Theogony), a gigantic water-snake-like monster with nine heads (the number varies), one of which was immortal."

Todo:
Pictures & Video ones I'm ready to release it to the public.
